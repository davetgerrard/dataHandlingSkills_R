# dataHandlingSkills_R
Code snippets to show examples of common data handling or  statistical test usage in R.


# Getting started with R


I recommend Dan Navarro's online book ["Learning Statistics with R"](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book).  Assuming you have already have access to an installed version of R, then you could start at [starting R]( https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/introR.html#startingR)
 You should bookmark this book as everything in there is useful and it explains many idiosynchronies of R and of Statistical thinking.
