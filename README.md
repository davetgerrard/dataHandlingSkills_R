# dataHandlingSkills_R
Code snippets to demonstrate some common data handling or statistical test usage in R. 

R commands are stored as text files with a ".R" extension. This is a convention to denote these text files contain R commands.  To use the commands, the easiest option is to download/copy the R file to your own computer and open them in R or Rstudio. You can then execute the commands line-by-line or all at once. 

If any *data* need to be loaded, they are stored in files in the sub-folder [data](/data/) and you will need to download these too and save them in a location that is accessible from R  (e.g. in a sub-folder called "data").


# Getting started with R

The code snippets in this folder assume you know some R basics on how to load and work with data.  

For absolute beginners, I recommend Dan Navarro's online book ["Learning Statistics with R"](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book).  Assuming you have already have access to an installed version of R, then you could start at [starting R]( https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/introR.html#startingR)
 You should bookmark this book as everything in there is useful and it explains many idiosynchronies of R and of Statistical thinking.
